The Versatile Intelligent Controller for Industry (VIKI) is an open source device for creating solutions 
related to control and monitoring for offices and industrial use. It provides edge compute capability at low cost,
and some popular isolated interface methods for machines and sensors (including some on-device sensors). 
The core of the VIKI hardware is a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a circuit board known as the VIKI main board. 
The Pi and VIKI main board plug together to form the VIKI main unit. Optional add-on cards can be attached 
using flat flex cables. The entire unit fits inside an industrial enclosure by Phoenix Contact. 
VIKI is intended to be hand-assembled and uses tools and electronic components that are easy for anyone to get going with.
